[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] walks the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]with an air of otherworldly awareness, and those fortunate, or perhaps unfortunate, enough to encounter [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] have found themselves on the receiving end of cryptic advice that hinted at profound truths.  \n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s guards speak of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s peculiar behavior and some whispered that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had become touched by the very mysteries of the heavens [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had sought to unveil. On especially dark nights, when the moon hides its face, and the stars shine with unparalleled brilliance, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can be found outside, gazing into the cosmic abyss and whispering to the stars."

 lifestyle_event_chains.26.desc:0 "After his communion with the stars and perhaps some greater entity, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has amassed insights and revelations that transcended ordinary human understanding, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] feels an overwhelming compulsion to share this newfound knowledge with the world. ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] desires to do so by compiling ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] revelations into a codex known simply as 'Meditations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].' It's a noble aspiration, one that could position [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] as a beacon of erudition and wisdom, potentially guiding countless others toward cosmic truths. However, amid the fervor of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s cosmic revelation, there lingers a subtle whisper from the stars, a faint echo of the entity [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] communed with. The stars themselves seem to yearn for secrecy, guarding their enigmatic insights from the prying eyes of the world. In the recesses of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s mind, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] recalls their inscrutable wishes and the cryptic messages of the cosmos. In the wrong hands, this knowledge could be misinterpreted, misused, or weaponized to bring about chaos. Choosing to withhold this celestial wisdom, in deference to the stars' enigmatic wishes, will certainly lead to speculation about [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s true motives and intensify the sense of mystery surrounding [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]. Should [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] choose the path of illumination, the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will come to revere [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] as a mystic, wiseman, and a guide to truth. Alternatively, heeding the call of the stars and protecting their whispered secrets would intensify the sense of ethereal mystic surrounding [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but cloak [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] future actions in a shroud of humility and piety."
