 japan_startup_desc:0 "The island of [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] was once home to many tribes of [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people. However, since the later parts of the #E Jomon Jidai#!, the incoming [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people coming from [GetProvince('(int32)9285').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E], began outpopulating, outproducing, and outbuilding the [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y].\n\nNow, the next step in [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] development is upon us, the #E Yayoi Jidai#!. The bickering [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] tribes will begin to centralize into formal kingdoms. One such tribe would grow to become synonymous with all [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people. Its dynasty would last for thousands of years, it would fight countless wars, and it would come to define what it means to be #E Japanese#!. Right now, however, the tribe and blood of [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] has yet to take its first steps towards this impressive legacy.\n\nThe [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] tribes remaining in [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E], called the #E Epi-Jomon#!, are entrenched in the north of the island. They will not be so willing to give up the rest of their autonomy over their ancestral homeland. Instead, they may look to reclaim their land and usher in a new #E Epi-Jomon Jidai#!. Meanwhile, the [GetCulture('wa').GetName|Y] tribes surrounding [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetName|E], as well as the further [GetCulture('kumaso').GetName|Y] and [GetCulture('aduma').GetName|Y] tribes remain a threat to [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] supremacy. They would happily divert fate and write their own legacies into the history books.\n\nThe fate of the #E #R Land of the Rising Sun#!#! has yet to be decided. Who will be the one to conquer the #E Yayoi Jidai?#!"

 mon_kingdoms_title:0 "The Mon Kingdoms"
 mon_kingdoms_desc:0 "The [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] people are a large group of people who inhabit the coasts of southeast asia. Heavily influenced by trade with highly civilized and rich neighboring cultures, some of the [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] of [GetProvince('(int32)9797').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] and [GetProvince('(int32)9815').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] would develop into powerful trade kingdoms in their own right.\n\nIn the west, the Kingdom of [GetCountry('PEG')GetName|E], established in their namesake capital of [GetProvince('(int32)9800').GetName|E], would blossom at the mouth of the #E Irrawaddy#!. They would eventually be the home to the greatest heights of civilization in the area. Just east lay the city of [GetProvince('(int32)9797').GetName|E] and her Kingdom of [GetCountry('THT')GetName|E], which would go on to unite the southern [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] people and establish itself into legend and lore for eternity as the first successful [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] kingdom. And finally, the Kingdom of [GetCountry('SHE')GetName|E], whose capital of [GetProvince('(int32)9815').GetName|E] would eventually be considered the golden cradle of #E Buddhism#!, and whose populace would someday birth the dominant #E Dvaravati#! culture, would flourish at meeting of mountains and rivers.\n\nThese three kingdoms would all go on to convert to #E Mahayana Buddhism#! and leave a lasting cultural legacy on both the [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] and the people who would come to live there in the far future. The legends of the three [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] kingdoms would start in this ancient period. Drive the fate of the [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] cultural legacy into the annals of history!"
